/**
 * A non-modal bottom sheet docked wherever the caller places it — built on M3's standalone
 * `BottomSheet`, not `ModalBottomSheet` or `BottomSheetScaffold`. It renders in the composition
 * hierarchy rather than a separate dialog window, so there is no scrim: the caller decides what
 * else is visible while the sheet is open. See docs/adr/0043 for why this shape was chosen over
 * the scaffold and the modal sheet.
 *
 * Deliberately not a scaffold and deliberately thin: it owns no `topBar`, no header slot and no
 * pinned-actions region — most sheets built on this will not need pinned actions at all, and the
 * caller is better placed to lay out its own [content]. This wrapper adds nothing but the app's own
 * design tokens on top of a bare `BottomSheet` call; every gesture, animation and predictive-back
 * behaviour is M3's, unmodified.
 *
 * **Placement is load-bearing — read this before wiring a call site.** `BottomSheet` positions
 * itself: its `draggableAnchors` modifier reads the *incoming* `constraints.maxHeight` (i.e. its
 * parent's bounded height) as the sheet's "full height", and internally translates its content down
 * by `fullHeight - sheetHeight` to land at the bottom — but the layout node it reports back to that
 * same parent is only the *content's own* natural size, not `fullHeight`. So:
 * - **Dock it as a plain, unaligned sibling** of the screen content in a `Box(Modifier.fillMaxSize())`
 *   — `Box(Modifier.fillMaxSize()) { ScreenContent(); FlashcardsBottomSheet(state = ...) { ... } }`.
 *   `Box`'s default alignment (`TopStart`, i.e. no `Modifier.align` at all) is correct: the sheet
 *   already puts itself at the bottom internally.
 * - **Never wrap it in `Modifier.align(Alignment.BottomCenter)`.** Confirmed by reading
 *   `androidx.compose.material3.internal.DraggableAnchors` (M3 1.5.0-alpha23): doing so bottom-aligns
 *   the small *reported* size on top of the sheet's own internal bottom offset — a double offset that
 *   pushes the real content roughly `2×(fullHeight - sheetHeight)` down, off-screen or clipped
 *   depending on content height. This was a real, reproduced bug in this codebase (not an M3 bug) —
 *   every sheet built on this component had it from the first commit, and no amount of tuning the
 *   *content*'s size ever could have fixed a bug at the call site.
 * - The `Box`'s own height must actually be bounded (e.g. `fillMaxSize()` inside a bounded parent,
 *   not `wrapContentHeight()`) — `fullHeight` above comes from that constraint, not the sheet's
 *   content.
 *
 * **Two shapes, one flag.** [state] is built with [rememberFlashcardsBottomSheetState], whose
 * `dismissible` parameter drives everything at once — [FlashcardsBottomSheetState.dismissible] is
 * read here to set `gesturesEnabled`, `backHandlerEnabled`, and whether the default drag handle
 * even renders:
 * - **Dismissible** (the default): fully interactive — swipeable, back-dismissible (including
 *   predictive back), with M3's default drag handle. This is the settings-sheet shape (Preview
 *   study session screen).
 * - **Non-dismissible**: no gestures, no back-dismiss, and no drag handle at all — a handle that
 *   can't do anything is worse than none. This is the permanently-docked-panel shape
 *   (`StudySessionScreen`'s card/rating panel is a named future consumer).
 *
 * An earlier version of this component took `dismissible` (and a separate `draggable`) as
 * independent parameters on *both* [FlashcardsBottomSheet] and the state builder. Review found
 * that unsound — verified against M3 1.5.0-alpha23 source, a `state` built non-dismissible
 * combined with this composable's own `dismissible = true` made the predictive-back handler call
 * `state.hide()` unconditionally, which throws once hidden is excluded from `enabledValues`. Two
 * independent copies of the same fact with nothing keeping them in sync. [FlashcardsBottomSheetState]
 * exists so there is exactly one flag, set once, at the state builder — this composable only reads
 * it back.
 *
 * Everything else this component adds on top of a bare `BottomSheet` call is the app's own design
 * tokens — top-rounded [MaterialTheme.cornerRadius.large] shape,
 * `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surfaceContainerLowest` container, [MaterialTheme.spacing.normal]
 * padding around [content] (`BottomSheet` applies none itself beyond the bottom system-bar inset —
 * content butts against the sheet's edges otherwise) — the shape/color pairing
 * [FlashcardsDialog][com.rossomak.flashcards.core.ui.composables.dialogs.FlashcardsDialog] also
 * uses. Predictive back, swipe, the bottom system-bar inset, and (for a dismissible sheet) the drag
 * handle's expand/collapse/dismiss accessibility actions all come from `BottomSheet` itself,
 * unmodified.
 *
 * **[content] is always shown in full, never scrolled or height-capped.** [rememberFlashcardsBottomSheetState]
 * only ever enables `Hidden`/`Expanded` — never `PartiallyExpanded` — so "expanded" always means
 * [content]'s complete, natural height. Content taller than the screen pins at the top and *clips*
 * rather than scrolling; a caller with variable-length content should keep it short enough to fit
 * rather than reach for `verticalScroll` here (see docs/adr/0043).
 *
 * @param state Owns the sheet's hidden/expanded value and its dismissibility. Build it with
 *   [rememberFlashcardsBottomSheetState].
 * @param onDismissRequest Invoked when the sheet is swiped, predictive-backed, or drag-handle-tapped
 *   to hidden. Never called for a non-dismissible [state], since none of those paths can reach
 *   hidden in that case.
 * @param content The sheet's body. One slot, no header, no pinned-actions region.

/**
 * [FlashcardsBottomSheet]'s single source of truth for dismissibility — a transparent wrapper
 * around the M3 [SheetState] plus the [dismissible] flag it was built with, produced only by
 * [rememberFlashcardsBottomSheetState]. `SheetState.enabledValues` is `internal`, so
 * [FlashcardsBottomSheet] cannot introspect an arbitrary [SheetState] to recover whether it was
 * built dismissible — bundling the flag alongside the state it describes is what makes the two
 * impossible to desynchronize. [sheetState] is exposed directly (not hidden behind delegate
 * methods) for anything a caller needs from raw `SheetState` — `currentValue`, `isVisible`,
 * `show()`/`hide()` — matching this component's own "deliberately thin" scope.
 *
 * Constructor is `internal` and [rememberFlashcardsBottomSheetState] is the sole factory: a public
 * constructor (or a public `copy()`, which a `data class` would generate at the same visibility)
 * would let a caller pair a `sheetState` with a `dismissible` value it wasn't actually built with,
 * reintroducing the exact desync this type exists to rule out. `private` was tried first but a
 * class-member `private` constructor is scoped to the class body, not the file — unlike top-level
 * `private` declarations — so even [rememberFlashcardsBottomSheetState] in this same file couldn't
 * call it; `internal` is the tightest visibility Kotlin allows a same-file-but-not-same-class caller.
 * [ConsistentCopyVisibility] pins the generated `copy()` to that same `internal` visibility — plain
 * `data class` only does this by default in a future Kotlin language version (KT-11914); without the
 * annotation, `copy()` stays public today and reopens the exact hole this constructor closes.

 * Builds the [FlashcardsBottomSheetState] [FlashcardsBottomSheet] expects: hidden and expanded
 * only, never partially expanded. Raw `rememberBottomSheetState()` defaults to enabling
 * `PartiallyExpanded` too, which this shape never wants (ADR-0043) — this helper exists so no call
 * site has to remember to exclude it.
 *
 * When [dismissible] is `false`, hidden is dropped from the enabled set entirely — not just
 * blocked at the [FlashcardsBottomSheet] call site — so the state starts at expanded and calling
 * `SheetState.hide()` on it throws, per M3's own contract. A `confirmValueChange` veto is also
 * attached, rejecting a settle at hidden, since `BottomSheet`'s drag physics always define a hidden
 * anchor for the gesture to rubber-band against, independent of the enabled set — moot here since
 * [FlashcardsBottomSheet] also disables gestures for a non-dismissible sheet, but kept as a
 * second line of defense against a direct `sheetState.hide()` call.
 *
 * @param dismissible Whether the sheet can ever be hidden — swiped, back-dismissed, or
 *   programmatically. `false` builds the permanently-docked-panel shape.
 * @param initiallyExpanded Whether a dismissible sheet starts expanded instead of hidden. Ignored
 *   when [dismissible] is `false`, which always starts expanded.
