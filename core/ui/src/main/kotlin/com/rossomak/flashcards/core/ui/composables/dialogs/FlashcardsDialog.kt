/**
 * The dialog scaffold every `Flashcards*Dialog` is built on — a thin skin over M3's [AlertDialog].
 *
 * Deliberately `internal`. Feature call sites cannot reach it, so they cannot assemble a dialog
 * that bypasses an L2 behavioral contract. A genuinely new shape (a three-action fork, say) is
 * added as a third L2 type rather than by hand-rolling this scaffold at a call site. L1 owns the
 * skin only — dismissal semantics, action rows and commit rules all belong to the L2 types
 * ([FlashcardsSingleActionDialog], [FlashcardsDecisionDialog]).
 *
 * Building on [AlertDialog] rather than a raw `Dialog` + `Surface` means M3 already provides the
 * behavior this scaffold would otherwise reimplement: min/max dialog width, the pinned action row,
 * dialog semantics for accessibility, and — the reason [icon] carries no companion alignment
 * parameter — a header that **centers itself when an icon is present** and start-aligns when it
 * isn't. Every dialog in the design language follows that pairing, so there is nothing to
 * configure.
 *
 * M3 does **not** scroll the `text` slot on its own, so this scaffold wraps [content] in
 * [Modifier.verticalScroll] itself — the one place content that grows past the viewport (a long
 * [supportingText], a dialog with many rows, extended context) is kept from pushing the pinned
 * action row off-screen.
 *
 * The one place M3's default differs from the design language is [supportingText], which M3 always
 * start-aligns; it is aligned here to match the title instead.
 *
 * > **Never put a `LazyColumn` inside [content].** It lands inside M3's scrolling `text` region,
 * > is measured with an infinite maximum height, and will throw. Content long enough to need
 * > laziness belongs in a bottom sheet or a full screen, not a dialog.

 * M3 hardcodes the `text` slot's horizontal inset (`AlertDialogDefaults`' private `TextPadding`,
 * 24.dp) with no parameter to widen it, so a row that wants its press indication to extend past
 * the prose margin — the way a list row does against a screen's margin — has no way to ask for the
 * width. It has to take it. The row hands the width straight back as inner padding, so only the
 * band grows; the row's own children stay on the prose margin.
 *
 * Applied by the row *container* ([FlashcardsMultiSelectGroup]) rather than by individual rows, so
 * this escape hatch exists in one place per stack rather than once per row.
