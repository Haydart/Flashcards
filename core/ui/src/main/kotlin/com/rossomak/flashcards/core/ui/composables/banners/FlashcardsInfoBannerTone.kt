 * Color coding of a [FlashcardsInfoBanner] drawn on a themed surface. Each tone maps onto a
 * valence pair in [com.rossomak.flashcards.core.ui.theme.SemanticColors] — the same pairs the
 * study screen's rating buttons use — but keeps banner vocabulary so a call site reads as intent
 * ("this tip is a caveat") rather than as a color.
 *
 * Ignored for [com.rossomak.flashcards.core.ui.composables.common.FlashcardsComponentStyle.OnGradient],
 * which is always the translucent white treatment.
