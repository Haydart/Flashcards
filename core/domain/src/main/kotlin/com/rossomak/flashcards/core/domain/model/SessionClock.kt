/**
 * A Study Session's elapsed-time accumulator — an immutable snapshot, in the same style as
 * [RatedSessionState]: [startClock], [stopClock] and [elapsedSeconds] are top-level pure functions
 * that take a snapshot in and return the next one (or, for [elapsedSeconds], a value), so a
 * ViewModel holds a `var` and reassigns it.
 *
 * Every operation takes the current time as a parameter; this type never reads a system clock
 * itself, which is what makes it testable with no dispatcher, fake clock or rule.
 *
 * The *policies* — starting at first card shown rather than route entry, pausing a backgrounded
 * session unless voice playback is active, excluding time spent on the Summary screen — are wiring
 * decisions the two session ViewModels own. This type only has to make them expressible: call
 * [stopClock] whenever a policy says time should stop accruing, [startClock] when it should resume.
 *
 * @param accumulated total elapsed time across every completed running span, kept as a [Duration]
 * rather than rounded to seconds until [elapsedSeconds] reports it — rounding happens exactly once,
 * there, so two callers reporting two different spans can never round differently.
 * @param runningSince the instant the current running span began; `null` while stopped.
